Live Site : https://ronaldlamdev.github.io/qc2020/

This is a personal and original website is about a tournament from one of my favorite video games of all time, Left 4 Dead 2.

I created this using Vite to implement the React.JS framework and Tailwind CSS, my favorite CSS framework. 

In this project, I learned how to embed Youtube videos into React with the iframe element and replacing "watch?v=" to "embed/" in
the URL of a video to use in the src attribute.

I got to practice creating a JS array of objects and mapping out the data in React JSX. I also learned how to install and use react icons 
in projects. 

I've always wanted to create a site dedicated to a L4D2 tournmanent and seeing another L4D2 tournament website (https://mavwar.com/) inspired me to do 
something like this, but better.
